# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

# Setup and run the application

* Install Dependencies
The default package manager for the project is yarn if you prefer NPM, remove the .lock file first
    ```bash
    yarn or npm i
    ```
* Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and alter the secrets there are SUGGESTED secrets inside of the example env file
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env

## Technologies 

The project is Create-React-App Typescript Redux template. All the request and state is handled with ReduxToolkit as well as RTK Query which provides request caching out of the box which could be beneficial for this use case.

The UI component library of choice was Mantine since it is lightweight and easy to integrate right out of the box.

The charts are handled by Highcharts React wrapper which is one of the biggest and maybe most complicated chart libraries and I would consider it an overkill for this project
but since I'm very familiar with it I decided it to use it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
